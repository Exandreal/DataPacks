The folders contain previous versions of my datapacks for different versions of Minecraft.
I only ever work with the current version of Minecraft, so the datapack file version is simply the corresponding Minecraft version.
Please keep in mind that old datapacks are no longer updated, and therefore might lack some of the features of the newer versions.

Feel free to use and modify the datapacks as much as you want! (Just remember to credit me if you share it with others)
